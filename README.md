# Remove-Cache-Memory

Clearing cache memory helps improve device performance by freeing up storage and removing temporary files that may cause glitches or slowdowns. It can resolve app crashes, loading issues, and outdated data problems. However, clearing cache does not delete important files or personal data, but it may cause apps to reload content, requiring additional time and data usage. Disclaimer: Proceed with caution, as clearing system cache or certain app data may lead to unexpected behavior. Always back up important data before performing any cache-clearing operations.
